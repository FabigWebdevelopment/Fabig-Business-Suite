## 💡 Key Advantages of Hybrid Model

**Why This Works:**

   - Build core system once (Starter/Professional)
   - Add industry modules incrementally (Premium)
   - Don't need 6+ completely different templates

2. **Easier to Sell**
   - "Everyone starts with same base system"
   - "Premium adds YOUR industry's specific automation"
   - Clear upgrade path: Starter → Professional → Premium

3. **Flexible for Unknown Industries**
   - Premium includes "1 custom automation request"
   - Thomas builds it on demand
   - Can handle ANY industry without pre-building

4. **Better Margins**
   - Starter/Professional = 87-90% margin (no custom work)
   - Premium = 77% margin (includes custom automation)
   - Custom work is PAID for via higher Premium price

5. **Demo Strategy Still Works**
   - Show 3 industry demos (Premium features)
   - Prospects see "Oh, this is perfect for barbers!"
   - But can still sell Starter/Professional to ANY industry
